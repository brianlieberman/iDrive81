Design Capstone Project

This application is one of the main components of our team's information system.  It allows the user to input their start and
stop locations as strings, then select the features of the stops they desire such as hotels and resturants. 
All of the exits along Interstate 81 matching the entered criteria between the two entered points are found by the application
and presented to the user.  The user can then select which exit they would like to stop at on their trip.  This selection 
then presents the user with the map view, which includes pins of the three points of interest they entered (start, stop, and exit).
The map also tracks and centers on the user's current location.  Selecting the exit's pin reveals the number of available parking spots 
at that exit.

Notes on this implementation:

1. Since this app focused primarily on design, the database of exit information only contains a subset of exits in Virginia for
demonstration purposes.  

2. The number of available parking spaces is simulated with a pseduorandom number, our implementation specification calls for the usuage of 
electronic parking sensors to feed an XML database for usuage in the application.



This application was created for the iPhone 4/4S/5 using the iOS 6 SDK.
